- add rating for functions in environment
- need more complex test-cases
- instead of guessing any function, use enflated result-types
  and only apply functions where one of the possible result-types
  matches current goal, _but_
    1) use let to bind the return value of the function application
       (and apply only one parameter at a time)
    2) float the let-binding as far up as possible in the expression
       tree.
  this should give significant performance improvement..
    theoretically :)
